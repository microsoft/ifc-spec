\label{sec:ifc-meta}

An IFC file may include partitions containing descriptions about the tools producing that file or other metadescription of the file.


\section{Producing Tool}
\label{sec:ifc-tool-maker}

A tool producing an IFC may embed a partition identifying that tool along with other information about that tool. 
That partition is called the \emph{tool maker} partition.
Each entry in that partition is a \type{TextOffset} representing a NUL-terminated UTF-8 encoded string (see \secref{sec:ifc-textoffset-data-type}).  
The partition has as many entries as the tool deems necessary for identification purposes.

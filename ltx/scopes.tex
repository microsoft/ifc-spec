\label{sec:ifc-scopes}

Every non-empty C++ translation unit contains at least one declaration, reachable from the global scope.

\section{Scope index}
\label{sec:ifc-scope-index}

A scope is referenced via an abstract reference of type \type{ScopeIndex} defined as \newtype{ScopeIndex}{32}
%
A value of type \type{ScopeIndex} is an index into the scope partition described below.  Valid values start at 1.  A \type{ScopeIndex} value 0 
indicates a missing scope, not an empty scope.

\section{Scope descriptor}
\label{sec:ifc-scope-desc}

A scope is a sequence of declarations (\secref{sec:ifc-scope-member}) -- this definition is a generalization of standard C++'s.

	}
	\caption{Structure of a \type{Scope}}
	\label{fig:ifc-scope-structure}
\end{figure}
%
The \field{start} is an index into the scope member partition (\secref{sec:ifc-scope-member}), designating the first declaration in the scope.
The \field{cardinality} designates the number of declarations in the scope.  Only members declared in that scope from that module partition
are accounted for in the scope descriptor.

\partition{scope.desc}

\note{The \field{global\_scope} field of the table of contents (\secref{sec:ifc-file-header}) is index into this partition.}

\section{Scope member}
\label{sec:ifc-scope-member}

A scope member represents a declaration.
%

	\structure{
		\DeclareMember{index}{DeclIndex} \\
	}
	\caption{Structure of a \type{Declarataion} -- a scope member}
	\label{fig:ifc-declaration-structure}
\end{figure}
%

The \field{index} field of a declaration is a \type{DeclIndex} value designating the entity (\secref{sec:ifc-decls}) referenced by this declaration.

\partition{scope.member}

\note{At this point in time, a \type{Declaration} is just a structure with an index as member.  In the future, it may evolve to contain explicitly attributes such as 'imported', 'exported', or 'internal'. }

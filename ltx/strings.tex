\label{sec:ifc-string-table}

Every IFC has a string table, a contiguous sequence of bytes.   A regular C++ identifier is stored in the string table as
a NUL-terminated sequence of bytes.

\section{Index type}
\label{sec:ifc-textoffset-data-type}

The type of the indices used to index into the  string table is defined as follows \newtype{TextOffset}{32}

The representation of identifiers  referenced by \type{TextOffset} indices  uses UTF-8 encoding and are NUL-terminated. 
 For string literals, see \secref{sec:ifc:ExprSort:String}.
